# Next.js Learning Project

A hands-on learning project where I'm exploring Next.js fundamentals by building practical features and pages. This repository documents my journey of learning and applying Next.js concepts.


This project represents my ongoing journey to learn Next.js through practical implementation. Each page demonstrates my understanding of different Next.js concepts as I continue to explore the framework.
